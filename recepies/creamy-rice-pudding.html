    <h4>How to Make Creamy Rice Pudding Step-By-Step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the Arborio rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.
        </li>               
        <li>In a large saucepan, combine the rice, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract,
            ground cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.
        </li>               
        <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low.
            Simmer, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender and the pudding has thickened,
            about 25-30 minutes. If using raisins, stir them in during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
        </li>               
        <li>Once the rice pudding has thickened to your desired consistency, remove it from the heat.
            Let it cool slightly before serving.
        </li>            
        <li>Serve the rice pudding warm or chilled, garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon               
            or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.
        </li>       
    </ol>
