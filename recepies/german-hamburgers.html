    <p>Frikadellen, the original hamburger, are served like a flattened meatball with string 
       beans and salad. I also like to use this recipe to make Swedish meatballs (but omit
       the paprika). My aunt in Hamburg, Germany, taught me this recipe, and I've been making
       it ever since. Serve with steamed string beans and tossed salad. Or serve on a kaiser
       roll with lettuce, tomato, pickled cucumbers, finely sliced deep-fried onions, and curry ketchup.</p>

    <h4>How to Make German Hamburgers Step-By-Step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the bread in the milk for a few minutes. Squeeze out excess milk and crumble the
            bread into a large bowl.
        </li>               
        <li>Add the ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, egg, salt, pepper, paprika, allspice,
            and nutmeg to the bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into 8 to 10 oval patties, about 1/2 inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook for
            about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through.
